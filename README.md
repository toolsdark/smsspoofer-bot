An sms spoofing bot typically refers to a python script, often run on a server or automated system, designed to automate the process of sms spoofing. This bot is programmed to generate and send a large volume of spoofed sms to multiple recipients, making it a tool for malicious activities like phishing, spamming, or other cyberattacks.
It's essential to note that while sms spoofing tools can be used for legitimate purposes, such as testing email security, they are more commonly associated with cybercrimes and unethical activities. Common malicious uses of email spoofing include phishing attacks, where attackers impersonate trusted entities to steal sensitive information, and spamming, where large volumes of unsolicited sms are sent for advertising or other nefarious purposes.

What SMS SPOOFING IS??

SMS Spoofing occurs when a sender manipulates address information. Often it is done in order to impersonate a user that has roamed onto a foreign network and is submitting messages to the home network. Frequently, these messages are addressed to destinations outside the home network – with the home SMSC essentially being “hijacked” to send messages into other networks. In advanced cases they can even hijack existing contacts in a phone. In other words, the hijacker's message can appear to be coming from any number.
